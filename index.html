        <p>
          I am a computer science major at Dartmouth College. At Dartmouth, I am a member of the
          <a href="http://www.dreamprogram.org/">DREAM</a> program,
          where we mentor underprivileged youth from surrounding area. I'm also a member of
          Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity, which I joined sophomore year. In my spare time, I like to
          work on software projects, go for runs, and drink coffee.
